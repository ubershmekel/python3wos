# The Python3Wos will not update

* 2018-04-22 - PyPI deprecated `top_packages` which caused this site to fail. At 95% compatibility this mission is long over so I don't see a reason to maintain Python3wos any further. If you're curious about the current download numbers, see more info on the [github issue.](https://github.com/ubershmekel/python3wos/issues/53)
* 2012-12 the site was renamed to ["Python 3 Wall of Superpowers"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4907755) after surpassing 50% compatibility.
* 2011-02 Python 3 Wall of Shame launched. Over 2 years after Python 3's release 9% of the 200 most popular packages were marked compatible.
* 2008-12-03 Python 3.0 was released.
* As listed on PyPI - packages in red don't support Python 3, packages in green do. Hopefully one day everything will be greener.
* Last and final status: 191/200 Updated: 2018-04-22T07:18:33.962000
